### Installation:

```sh
 npm install steam-user
 npm install steamrep
 npm install steam-totp
```
After installed, you can start the bot with: node steambot.js

## Editing config files:
#### Usage of 'config.js' :
- Admin : "76561198041931474", SteamID64 of the account which will control the bot!

- StartOnlineOROffline : '1' you can start the bot in online (1) mode or offline (0), only the game2idle will work!,

- WhenLogonStartIdlingAllGames : '0', when the account goes on , it starts idling all games in config 'game2idle',

- LogonIdlingNonSteam : '0', If you want to idle all your games and put a non steam game first you can change 0 to 'Anything', and change 'WhenLogonStartIdlingAllGames' to 0,

- 'AllFunctions' : "1", 0 to all functions stay off, or 1 to turn on all functions,

#### Usage of 'savedbots.js' :

- BOTS : "76561198041931474,76561198177157710", this will prevent bots spamming each other if you got multiple bots
